  <h1>Boat Laws</h1>
<p>We are a Pennsylvania Based Company. Here is an overview of our state laws!</p>
<ul>
	<h2>General Laws</h2>
<li>A Coast Guard-approved wearable life jacket or personal flotation device (PFD) is required for each occupant on all types of boats in all waters.</li>
<li>Motorboats (including boats powered by electric motors) must be registered, and they must be registered in their state of principal use.
</li>
<li>Boat operators of boats with greater than 25 horsepower and born on or after Jan. 1, 1982, may not operate unless they have obtained and have in possession a Boating Safety Education Certificate.
</li>
<h2>Personal Water Craft</h2>
<li>All PWC (personal watercraft) operators must have obtained and have in possession a Boating Safety Education Certificate.
Persons 11 years of age or younger may NOT operate a boat with greater than 25 horsepower or a PWC.</li>
<li>Persons 12–15 years of age may not operate a PWC with any passengers on board 15 years of age or younger or rent a PWC.
</li>
<h2>Unpowered Watercraft</h2>
<li>Owners of unpowered boats (canoes, kayaks, rowboats, stand-up paddleboards, etc.) can launch their boats at Commission lakes, access areas and properties, and at PA state parks and forests if their boats display the Commission’s launch use permit OR boat registration, OR PA state parks launch permit OR mooring permit. An unpowered boat may have a registration OR launch permit, but it is not required to have both. The Commission does NOT recognize launch permits from other states.
</li>
<h2>LifeJackets</h2>

<li>Boaters are required, by law, to wear life jackets on boats less than 16 feet in length or any canoe or kayak during the cold weather months from November 1 through April 30. This requirement is intended to protect boaters from the dangers of cold water shock if they fall into the water.
</li>
<li>All boats must have a USCG-approved wearable life jacket on board for each person.
</li>
<li>In addition to wearable life jackets, boats 16 feet and over must have a throwable device (ring buoy, life ring or buoyant seat cushion) on board. Canoes and kayaks, regardless of length, are not required to carry a throwable device.</li>

<li>Life jackets must be used in accordance with any requirements on the approval label. Must wear if under age 12.
</li>
<li>All life jackets must be in good and serviceable condition and legibly marked showing the USCG approval number. This means the life jacket must be fully functional, free of tears or defects in the material. They must also be the appropriate size, readily accessible, and not a nonwearable device.
</li>
</ul>
